    <p>Thrissur (Malayalam: [t̪riʃ(ː)uːr] ⓘ), formerly Trichur, also known by its historical name Thrissivaperur, is a
        city and the headquarters of the Thrissur district in Kerala, India. It is the third largest urban agglomeration
        in Kerala after Kochi and Kozhikode, and the 21st largest in India.[3][4] The city is built around a 65-acre (26
        ha) hillock called the Thekkinkaadu Maidaanam which seats a large Hindu Shiva Temple. It is located central of
        the state, and 304 kilometres (189 mi) north-west of the state's capital city, Thiruvananthapuram. Thrissur was

        the Malayalam month 'medam'.[5]</p>

        Lady of Dolours Syro-Malabar Catholic Basilica, the largest Christian church in India.[9] India's first mosque,
